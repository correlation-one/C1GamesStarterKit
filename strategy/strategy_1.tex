\item Offense
\begin{enumerate}
\item define $x$ = total number of upgraded Turret in \{[1,15],[2,15]\}, $y$ = total number of upgraded Turret in \{[1,14],[2,14]\,[3,14]\}, $z$ = total number of Turret(not upgraded) in  \{[1,15],[2,15],[1,14],[2,14]\,[3,14]\}.\\\\define $\bar{x}$ = total number of upgraded Turret in \{[25,15],[26,15]\}, $y$ = total number of upgraded Turret in \{[24,14],[25,14],[26,14]\}, $z$ = total number of Turret(not upgraded) in  \{[25,15],[26,15],[24,14],[25,14]\,[26,14]\}.\\ \\MP is my mobile points, SP is my structure points. Define\\ $O(x,y,z,\bar{x},\bar{y},\bar{c},MP,SP,H) = (a,b,c,d,e,f,MP_l,SP_l)$, where $a$ is the first round scout needed, $b$ is the second round scout needed, $c$ is the support needed, $d$ is the Demolisher needed,$e$ is the Interceptor needed. $f$ controls the position of scout. $MP_l$ is the MP left after deploy offense or active defese. $SP_l$ is the SP left after deploy offense or active defese. $H$ is my health
\item If $d \neq 0$ or $e \neq 0$, put Demolisher at  [15,1] and Interceptor at [19,5]. If $c \neq 0$, put support in\\ \{[13,3],[14,3],[15,4],[16,5],[17,6],[18,7],[14,4],[15,5],[16,6],[17,7]\} orderly.
\item If $a \neq 0$ or $b \neq 0$ and $f =1$, put first scout at[11,2], second scout at [10,3] and Stop right active defense for 1 turn, else continue right active defense. If $a \neq 0$ or $b \neq 0$ and $f =2$, put first scout at[19,5], second scout at [20,6] and Stop left active defense for 1 turn, else continue right active defense.
