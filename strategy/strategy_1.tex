\item If $d \neq 0$ or $e \neq 0$, put Demolisher at  [15,1] and Interceptor at [19,5]. If $c \neq 0$, put support in\\ \{[13,3],[14,3],[15,4],[16,5],[17,6],[18,7],[14,4],[15,5],[16,6],[17,7]\} orderly.
\item If $f =0$, keep both left and right active defense. If $f =1$, put $a$ number of scouts at [11,2] and $b$ number of scouts at [10,3] and Stop the right active defense(defined in 8(b)) for 1 turn,keep the left active defense. If $a \neq 0$ or $b \neq 0$ and $f =2$, put $a$ number of scouts at[19,5] and $b$ number of scouts at [20,6] and Stop the left active defense(defined in 8(a)) for 1 turn,keep the right active defense.
