# C1GamesStarterKit

Welcome to the C1 Starter Kit! This collection of scripts and an example `starter-algo` should help
you start on your journey to developing the ultimate algo.

For more details about competitions and the game itself please check out our
[main site](https://terminal.c1games.com/rules).

## First Time Walkthrough

1. We recommend familiarizing yourself with the game and creating a strategy through playing by
hand before starting your algo
2. Once you are ready, open algo-strategy in starter-algo using the editor of your choice and
create your strategy using the functions provided in gamelib. The provided strategy has examples
with explanations on how to do this.
3. Explore changes to your algo by running matches using our Command Line Interface, detailed below.
4. When you are ready to test your algo, you can use the CLI to archive the algo, saving it as a zip
with the desired algo name that is visible to other users.
5. You can upload it on the "My Algos" page of the terminal site, then that’s it! Your zipped algo
will automatically begin playing in matches.

## Documentation for Creators

### Concepts and Data Structures

#### `location`

A list with two integers corresponding to the x, y coordinate of a tile in the grid
- Example: [9,13]

#### `player_index`

0 indicates you, 1 indicates your opponent

#### GameState

This class is a representation of the current game state, and contains many helper methods to
simplify placing units, determining paths, and other common actions. The starting strategy many
algos are based off of creates `game_state`, which can be used to access these methods. Examples
of using `game_map` to use these methods can be seen within the starter strategy.

#### GameMap

This class holds information about the current location of units on the game map, and has functions to help you interact with the map

#### GameUnit

The GameUnit class represents one unit. You will most often access it by getting the list of units on a given tile via game_map.map[x,y] then getting a unit from this list.

### Using the C1 CLI

In the below examples, we assume your working directory is C1GamesStarterKit and you are storing
your algos in the algos/ directory

#### Creating your first algo

Fork the provided `starter-algo` to create a modifiable base of your own. You will likely want to
give your algos descriptive names but for this example we will create an algo called
`renamed-algo`.

    $ scripts/fork_algo.sh algos/starter-algo algos/renamed-algo

Modify the files in `algos/renamed-algo/` to create your own strategy.

#### Running matches locally between algos

Easily run a match between two local algos using the `run_match.sh` script. The resulting replay
file will be saved in the replays/ directory and can be uploaded and watched on
https://terminal.c1games.com/playground.

For example, if you wanted to run `starter_algo` against the `renamed_algo` of your own creation in
the command line, you can cd into the C1GamesStarterKit and run the following command:

    $ scripts/run_match.sh algos/starter_algo algos/renamed_algo

This will also save a replay file in replays/, which you can upload on our site to watch your game

#### Uploading your algo

Zip the entire algo directory or run the `archive_algo.sh` script to zip an algo. It will be saved in
the /dist directory and can then be uploaded on terminal.c1games.com/myalgos to compete in ranked matches.

While using C1GamesStarterKit as your working directory, to zip an algo in the algos folder, you can use

    $ scripts/archive_algo.sh dist/renamed-algo.zip algos/renamed-algo

Check out all the [C1 CLI Commands](https://github.com/correlation-one/C1GamesStarterKit/blob/dev/docs/C1_CLI_COMMANDS.md) for more information.

### Custom Config

Customize the "debug" values in game-configs.json to control the level of error/debug information printed during a match.
