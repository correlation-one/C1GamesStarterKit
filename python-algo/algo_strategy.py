"""
Most of the algo code you write will be in this file unless you create new
modules yourself. Start by modifying the 'on_turn' function.

Advanced strategy tips: 

  - You can analyze action frames by modifying on_action_frame function

  - The GameState.map object can be manually manipulated to create hypothetical 
  board states. Though, we recommended making a copy of the map to preserve 
  the actual current map state.
