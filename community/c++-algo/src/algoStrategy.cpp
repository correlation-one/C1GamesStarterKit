        Most of the algo code you write will be in this file unless you create new
        modules yourself. Start by modifying the 'on_turn' function.

        Advanced strategy tips :
            Additional functions are made available by importing the AdvancedGameState
            class from gamelib / advanced.py as a replacement for the regular GameState class in game.py.

        You can analyze action frames by modifying algoCore.h/cpp.

        The GameState.map object can be manually manipulated to create hypothetical
        board states.Though, it is recommended to make a copy of the map to preserve
        the actual current map state.
