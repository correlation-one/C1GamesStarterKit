### GameLib Library

This is a small, simple library to make interfacing with the Terminal engine easier.
It is very heavily modeled after the `python-algo` gamelib project.

It contains classes to make it easier to submit your turns and get the information from the terminal engine.

It also contains a `GameState` class which contains functions to allow you to create theoretical game states and to test strategies before you submit them to the engine. This includes things like pathfinding and predicting future resources.
