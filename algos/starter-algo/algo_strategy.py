Most of the algo code you write will be in this file unless you create new
modules yourself. Start by modifying the 'on_turn' function.

Advanced strategy tips: 

Additional functions are made available by importing the AdvancedGameState 
class from gamelib/advanced.py as a replcement for the regular GameState class 
in game.py.

You can analyze action frames by modifying algocore.py.

The GameState.map object can be manually manipulated to create hypothetical 
board states. Though, we recommended making a copy of the map to preserve 
the actual current map state.
